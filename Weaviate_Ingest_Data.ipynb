Now you can just stop everything else and use this.\\n\\nThis kit has everything you need to get your skin on to happier days! My best selling prebiotic facial cleanser, my high performance prebiotic facial toner and the best, most nourishing facial cream that doesn’t irritate my Derm! ✨\\n\\nYou’ll also get an adorable OB bunny headband, a super soft Konjac sponge to exfoliate and travel sample of the Agent Holi Mane so you can test it out before committing. This is my best selling collagen because… it also WORKS!

And it’s hard because mine is just under my eyes where the skin is more delicate but these products are a dream and my skin is almost back to “normal!”\\nI suddenly developed severe eczema and dermatitis on my face & hands 1½ years ago, my Dr prescribed several creams and steroids, nothing helped, until Organic Bunny recommended the 4 products from Aleavia & Earth Harbor! I've been using them consistently for almost 6 months now and my skin has completely cleared up! I still continue to use all 4 to prevent flare ups, but I would use anyway because my skin is so healthy and glowy now! ❤️ It was a miracle to me because I never thought I would heal or live without the insane itching and pain. So thankful for Amanda & Alex and all the resources they offer! ❤️\\n@live_green_live_great_ I agree. Most, if not all of my Products are toxin free. I do need to work on my Diet a little more though.\\n        \", 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/organicbunny/'}\n",

Treatment seems to have little effect on mature stretch marks.\\n\\n* Massage the product into your stretch marks.Taking time to massage the product gently into your skin may make it more effective.\\n\\n* Apply the product every day for weeks.If you see results, they take weeks to appear.\\n\\n📖 A few products I’ve been testing on my belly:\\n\\n@theinkeylist hyaluronic acid (using some form of HA twice or three times a day) \\n@cerave_canada baby ointment (seals everything in)\\n@tower28beauty  spray (helps with itching) \\n\\nI alternate with other products as well!

It’s a cool store with lots of affordable skincare, makeup, and haircare products. I would go here just to see what they have, and pick up a few things that catch your eye! \\n\\nPharmacy: these are all over France, you can’t really go wrong. I found Paris had the best prices, especially the busier stories. Is the shopping experience great? no. It feels a little crammed and it can be super busy with tourists. That beig said, you can find some amazing deals, especially for Caudile and Nuxe. I didn’t go wild with SPF because I knew I was going to Japan and Korea, but I already have guides on my faves! \\n\\nLonger reviews are already on my feed! \\n\\nHope this helps, happy shopping! \\n\\nBrands I mentioned and bought from:\\n@biodermacanada / @biodermausa \\n@laboratoiresvrca / @laboratoire_svr \\n@eucerin_ca / @eucerinus \\n@caudalieus \\n@nuxeca / @nuxe \\n@larocheposay \\n\\n#frenchpharmacy\\xa0#frenchskincare\\xa0#parisskincare\\xa0#normalstores\\n        hashtags: #frenchpharmacy #frenchskincare #parisskincare #normalstores\\n        mentions: @vichylaboratoires @biodermacanada @biodermausa @laboratoiresvrca @laboratoire_svr @eucerin_ca @eucerinus @caudalieus @nuxeca @nuxe @larocheposay\\n        commentsCount: 10\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 19859\\n        videoPlayCount: 59595\\n        ownerUsername: uglyducklingskincare\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Love normal ❤️in Norway\\nNuxe is absolutely horrible, all their stuff is full of perfume, I ended up using the face creams on my neck and decolletage  because of the strong smell.

I wouldn’t repurchase anything from Nuxe 👎🏻\\nI think that except a couple of products (but you can find something similar) this products are also available on other European countries like Spain or Italy.\\nSo if someone is not going to France but to other country…you can still find SVR, Caudalie, Nuxe, Bioderma, la Roche poche, Eucerin…and more\\nYou missed A313 retinol!!!

Listen up! Forget toxic Biore pore strips that contain ingredients like parabens, hormone disrupting fragrances, petroleum and silicones and while I won’t argue that they may work well, there are way cleaner options to try that are just as effective, too!\\xa0\\n\\nWant to try any of the options in this reel? Comment PORES and I will DM you the links! 🎉\\n\\nI was skeptical this would work as well as promised but truly, it blew me away! I have a zoom mirror and I had noticed lately that my pores seemed more clogged than usual. I have been SO busy that honestly, my skin has taken a back seat and it showed! My normally clear pores seemed clogged\\xa0with oil, make up and debris and I needed a solution fast.😒\\n\\nSo, I asked our holistic Esthetician and she told me to EXFOLIATE which I knew, but she said to be consistent\\xa0with this mask and I swear, after just 3 scrubs, my pores have unclogged at least 75%. Soon, I will be free and clear of gross clogged pores so I just had to share! 🙌🏻\\n\\nWhy it Works- This mask contains two types of exfoliants which explains\\xa0why it is SO effective! This mask uses a physical scrub\\xa0of tiny wax beads then mixed with the enzymes from Rice and Papaya Extracts to clear our pores and smooth away rough, dull skin leaving it feeling soft, supple and renewed. 🤩\\n\\nBesides clearing pores and softening the skin, it also brightens and evens the skin tone! Papaya extracts, Rice and Vitamin C also help to quickly dissolve dead skin cells, revealing younger, brighter looking skin where as the Coconut Oil and Honey nourish and hydrate to help improve skin’s elasticity so this is one mask you will always find in my routine! 🪄\\n\\nBest For- Anyone who wants the above benefits! This is even great for acne-prone skin, you would simply apply it and let it sit, as you want to avoid scrubbing physically and transferring bacteria!\\xa0This mask is great to:\\n\\n✨ Brighten skin\\n🙂 Smooth skin\\n☁️ Soften skin\\n💦 Hydrate skin\\n🥥 Moisturize skin\\n💥 Remove dead skin\\n👋🏻 Removes debris\\n😍 Unclogs pores\\n\\nIf you need help with any of the above, comment PORES and I will DM you the links! 🥳\\n        hashtags: \\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 161\\n        likesCount: 194\\n        videoViewCount: 5764\\n        videoPlayCount: 17213\\n        ownerUsername: organicbunny\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Pores\\nPores\\nPores\\nPores 🙌\\nPores\\nLink sent to your dm! 🤗\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/organicbunny/'}\n",

Even just eliminating red wine can help a lot! And if you’re somebody who gets puffy after a facial or tattoos, cutting out wine for a few days before your appointments can make a difference. \\n\\nI know, I know… most health advice suggests increasing fermented foods - but everyone is unique and no health advice applies to everyone.

Retinal, also known as retinaldehyde is a well-studied retinoid that has a more efficient delivery system than retinol. Its vibrant yellow hue is due to the high concentration of Retinaldehyde. \\n\\nThis Retinal serum has been created with Encapsulated Retinaldehyde and Synthetic Oat Analogues, which help make the formula more nourishing and not as drying and irritating as a lot of Retinals can be on the skin.\\n\\nEsthetician Tip: Start using the Retinal 0.2% Emulsion once a week, then gradually build up to twice a week as your skin gets more comfortable with Retinal use. Always follow up with hydrating serum, moisturizer, and SPF in the morning. \\n\\n#TheOrdinaryPartner #theordinary\\n        hashtags: #TheOrdinaryPartner #theordinary\\n        mentions: @TheOrdinary’s\\n        commentsCount: 17\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 2687\\n        videoPlayCount: 9729\\n        ownerUsername: seangarrette\\n        taggedUsers: @theordinary\\n        latestComments: ✨\\n🖤🖤🖤\\nI will have to check this out 😍\\nAll I wanna say is... good skin envy is real!!!\\nWhat’s your middle name?\\n🔥🔥🔥🔥\\nCan’t wait to try this.\\nYour skin looks AMAZING 🤩\\nThis is my latest skincare love ❤\\nOkay *adds to cart!*\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/seangarrette/'}\n",

Such a great idea from @bbpro_hollieolivia especially if you’re losing your lids a bit, like me. The look focuses all the attention onto the lash line rather than anywhere above which might be hooded or you just don’t have lot of room there. I used Bobbi Brown Long Wear Cream Liner Stick in Hot Chocolate to blend close to the lash line and then use a brush to blur (so don’t worry if your line is a bit wobbly). Then, using a powder shadow (I used a shade called Dusk from the Bobbi Brown Nude on Nude palette) and a thin brush, draw a line in the second colour just above the first shade. Finally, take a fluffy brush and gently blend the two lines together. If I can do it, so can you :-) #bobbibrown #bobbibrownpromakeup #doublelining #hoodedlids\\n        hashtags: #bobbibrown #bobbibrownpromakeup #doublelining #hoodedlids\\n        mentions: @bbpro_hollieolivia\\n        commentsCount: 23\\n        likesCount: 206\\n        videoViewCount: 2083\\n        videoPlayCount: 6039\\n        ownerUsername: britbeautyblog\\n        taggedUsers: @bobbibrownuk @bbpro_hollieolivia\\n        latestComments: Nice trick…must buy some brown eyeliners 😍(in my old age) 😍\\nThank you so much for all your tips and suggestions… love your Instagram… and you  look fab with this tip 💕\\n@bbpro_hollieolivia is an absolutely fab MUA.

I am quite surprised with this cleanser as it gives a dense micro foam that leaves skin feeling very clean but without the typical tight feeling of a foam cleanser. I found this very effective in removing sunscreen and primer; but if you are wearing makeup do remove it first. I also noted that this kept my blackheads at bay used regularly. I absolutely love this one, a definite keeper in my stash also love the refreshing natural citrus scent.\\n𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\\n\\n𝙌𝙮𝙤𝙦𝙮𝙤 𝙅𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙈𝙞𝙨𝙩\\nThis is the most unique mist I have ever used, it has a jelly texture but sprays out to be a fine watery mist. I found this to be very hydrating and also soothing. I love using this between my skincare steps as well as a toner after cleanser. This used with the cleanser really replenished back moisture into skin. I would recommend this for all skin types & it has the most refreshing natural citrus scent. This did not flare up Rosacea despite being citrusy in scent.\\n𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\\n\\n𝙌𝙮𝙤𝙦𝙮𝙤 𝘼𝙡𝙡-𝙄𝙣-𝙊𝙣𝙚 𝘾𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙢\\nThis is a very light hydrating lotion than a cream. This has a nice citrusy fresh scent but it did not flare up my Rosacea. I found this very hydrating but not occlusive enough, this absorbs so fast into skin once applied without leaving a sticky feeling. I personally found after 4 hrs sitting in a cold air-conditioned environment my skin ended up feeling tight and dry. I actually use this as a lotion, then I apply a more occlusive cream on top. I love layering two layers of these before putting on a heavy cream. I think all skin types would enjoy this one definitely.\\n𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\\n\\nYou can purchase via the link in my bio.\\n\\n#qyoqyojeju #qyoqyotangerine #tangerineskincare #jejuskincare #jejutangerine #foamcleanser #jellymist #allinonecream #joannerecommend #joannerecommends #joannereviews #joannereview\\n        hashtags: #qyoqyojeju #qyoqyotangerine #tangerineskincare #jejuskincare #jejutangerine #foamcleanser #jellymist #allinonecream #joannerecommend #joannerecommends #joannereviews #joannereview\\n        mentions: @qyoqyo_jeju\\n        commentsCount: 33\\n        likesCount: 70\\n        videoViewCount: 296\\n        videoPlayCount: 1435\\n        ownerUsername: joannelek\\n        taggedUsers: @qyoqyo_jeju @qyo.qyo\\n        latestComments: LOVE @qyoqyo_jeju beautiful products 😍🍊✨✨\\nOh wow, all the products sound so good.

The problem is- it wasn’t that great. There’s a line out the door, it’s packed inside, and you won’t get the kind of service you would expect from such a renowned name. I also could not find one perfume that I loved. Many of them came off as very powdery. \\n\\n@zhorparfums, however, had everything you would expect from a luxury parfumerie. Their selection contained some of the best perfumes from around the world. The store was gorgeously decorated as well, but it was the staff that made the experience. They were so knowledgeable and really tailored the scents they brought you to your preferences.

(Contrary to what you've been told, not all retinols are sun sensitive... in fact this one is sun protective.) This serum is gold because it also has Vit C, Vit E and peptides. \\n\\n✨️@eminenceorganics Rosehip Triple C Serum - I love an oil! Especially in Colorado. And the bonus is it has Vit C!

I managed to shrug it off though and went back to sleep. My friend had two cats who also seemed to notice something because the following day one of them started running in circles very fast and on another occasion one of them seemed to be chasing something invisible up the stairs. They'd also randomly walk to a door of a small storage room and start meowing.

Not only did it offer customized consultations (you do have to que, so go when it’s not as busy), but they also offer makeup lessons, custom engraving on specific skincare and makeup produds, and a “inner beauty” meditation experience - which also features their most famous serum of all time - the ultimune power infusing concentrate. \\n\\nThe inner beauty meditaiton is around $27usd/$38cad, and it was a really cool experience. I was the only one who booked it at the time, so I had the whole place to myself. If guided meditaiton is your thing, and you want to try something different, this could be for you. I don’t think i’d do it again, but it was definitely worth the experience for me, also because the store was SO busy, so it was nice to escape! \\n\\nThey also give you a complimentary tea to take home which was lovely, and during the ritual, you can use as much Ultimune as you want - a bonus since I love it. \\n\\nIf you’re in Ginza and you want to try a unique shopping experience, definitely check this store out! \\n\\nHave you tried the @shiseido sunscreen stick?!\\n        hashtags: \\n        mentions: @shiseido\\n        commentsCount: 22\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 23335\\n        videoPlayCount: 53838\\n        ownerUsername: uglyducklingskincare\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: How long would you say you were there for?\\nThanks for sharing @uglyducklingskincare Do you have to make an appointment?

I have wanted to find a good, nut-free coconut option, BUT I cannot handle the tang of most of the brands I have tried in the past. I was curious, could I find a low-tang, Organic Coconut Yogurt option for us? 🥥\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nFollow along as we test out all of the Organic options we can find! ⬇️\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nWe started out with the famous Coconut Cult; this one was SO tangy! Thick and creamy, with great texture and great ingredients, but way too tangy for me. If you love tang, this is the one for you.\\xa0\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nCocojune was one we both loved. Low tang, the vanilla had a great taste, and I would enjoy it daily. The only con is semi-high sugar with 6g per serving.🤗\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nCoconut Cult also makes a chocolate mousse, and this was much better than their original IMO because it had Coconut Nectar to add some sweetness. Amazingggg texture, this would be great with granola and berries for a dessert. It definitely has a tang, though; too high for me, but I would tolerate it.🍫\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nCocoyo vanilla really was a winner for us both also. Low tang, lower sugar at only 2g per serving. I wish it had the texture of the Coconut Cult; then, it would be perfection. This does use Stevia, which I do not usually like, but in this, it was totally fine with no aftertaste.\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nHarmless Harvest makes a clean option, it’s a good option if it’s all you can find, but we like Cocojune more.\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nCulina I have had before, and it’s good, super clean, but very tangy. Must like tang to like this one. This one also has pretty high sugar for how tangy it is, 7g per serving. I would rather eat Cocojune.\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nSo Delicious has way too high sugar, period. And a lot more blah ingredients. I would avoid this one for the most part; I do not see the point in its creation.😖\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nOverall, today’s winner was the Cocoyo! Low sugar, clean + organic\\xa0ingredients, and minimal tang! We added this with some Organic Granola and Organic blueberries, and damn, it’s amazing and definitely a new snack we will add on rotation.😍\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nSo, there you have it! Our fave Organic Coconut Yogurts! Which have you tried? Which do you want\\xa0to try?

Also been wanting to try cocojune! ☺️\\nI LOVE Siggi’s coconut yogurt but it might have more sugar than these options. I can’t wait to try the Cocoyo.

Listen up! Forget toxic Biore pore strips that contain ingredients like parabens, hormone disrupting fragrances, petroleum and silicones and while I won’t argue that they may work well, there are way cleaner options to try that are just as effective, too!\\xa0\\n\\nWant to try any of the options in this reel? Comment PORES and I will DM you the links! 🎉\\n\\nI was skeptical this would work as well as promised but truly, it blew me away! I have a zoom mirror and I had noticed lately that my pores seemed more clogged than usual. I have been SO busy that honestly, my skin has taken a back seat and it showed! My normally clear pores seemed clogged\\xa0with oil, make up and debris and I needed a solution fast.😒\\n\\nSo, I asked our holistic Esthetician and she told me to EXFOLIATE which I knew, but she said to be consistent\\xa0with this mask and I swear, after just 3 scrubs, my pores have unclogged at least 75%. Soon, I will be free and clear of gross clogged pores so I just had to share! 🙌🏻\\n\\nWhy it Works- This mask contains two types of exfoliants which explains\\xa0why it is SO effective! This mask uses a physical scrub\\xa0of tiny wax beads then mixed with the enzymes from Rice and Papaya Extracts to clear our pores and smooth away rough, dull skin leaving it feeling soft, supple and renewed. 🤩\\n\\nBesides clearing pores and softening the skin, it also brightens and evens the skin tone! Papaya extracts, Rice and Vitamin C also help to quickly dissolve dead skin cells, revealing younger, brighter looking skin where as the Coconut Oil and Honey nourish and hydrate to help improve skin’s elasticity so this is one mask you will always find in my routine! 🪄\\n\\nBest For- Anyone who wants the above benefits! This is even great for acne-prone skin, you would simply apply it and let it sit, as you want to avoid scrubbing physically and transferring bacteria!\\xa0This mask is great to:\\n\\n✨ Brighten skin\\n🙂 Smooth skin\\n☁️ Soften skin\\n💦 Hydrate skin\\n🥥 Moisturize skin\\n💥 Remove dead skin\\n👋🏻 Removes debris\\n😍 Unclogs pores\\n\\nIf you need help with any of the above, comment PORES and I will DM you the links! 🥳\\n\\n#cleanbeauty #organicbeauty #nontoxicbeauty #holisticskincare\\n        hashtags: #cleanbeauty #organicbeauty #nontoxicbeauty #holisticskincare\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 1359\\n        likesCount: 451\\n        videoViewCount: 15960\\n        videoPlayCount: 35345\\n        ownerUsername: organicbunny\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Pores\\nPores\\nPORES\\nPores\\nPores\\nLinks sent! ✨\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/organicbunny/'}\n",

So don’t brush your hair when it’s wet! (Or at least ensure it’s properly conditioned so it has some protection) I prefer for it to be dry before I brush it. \\n\\nCOCONUT OIL BEFORE WASHING\\nI know there’s all kinds of stories about whether coconut oil is good or bad for your hair. But the science is pretty clear: applying coconut oil to your mids and ends protects your hair from potential damage from getting it wet and washing it. I apply it the night before (or about 15 minutes before if I forgot) to let it absorb. \\n\\nBE GENTLE ON WET HAIR\\nYour hair hates being wet as it’s more vulnerable for breakage. So when trying to get wet hair dry, be very gentle. Do not pull and squeeze excess water out, or rough it up with a towel!\\n\\nHAIR OILINESS\\nis pretty much set in stone. There’s not really much you can do to change this. It differs per person! I have to wash my hair every 2-3 days (I have oily skin so my scalp is also oily quickly) but some can go a week or longer without washing. \\n\\nSERUM ON ENDS\\nOr any hair oil that is silicone based. It’ll form a protective layer which helps prevent tugging and rubbing on your hair that can cause breakage.\\n\\nOILING YOUR SCALP\\nIt might feel nice if you have itchy dandruff to oil your scalp, but this is a bad idea. The yeast that caused dandruff actually feeds on oil - so oiling your scalp can actually make dandruff worse! Instead look for scalp treatments with ingredients like zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid and selenium sulfide. \\n\\nWhat’s the best hair care tip you learned on Instagram?\\n\\n#haircaretips #hairtok #haircaretip\\n        hashtags: #haircaretips #hairtok #haircaretip\\n        mentions: @curlbellaa @sciencemeetscosmetics @alexandrarriaga @abbeyyung\\n        commentsCount: 20\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 2951\\n        videoPlayCount: 12842\\n        ownerUsername: deskincarejunkie\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Love these tips! 👏🏼❤️\\ngood tips, thanks\\nYes 🙌\\ngreat tips 😍\\n@buildyourskin Thank you!\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/deskincarejunkie/'}\n",

More details on my likes and dislikes are in the video before this one! Drop any questions below! \\n\\n☑️Here’s why I would BUY:\\n\\n@theinkeylist salicylic cleanser is a good, gentle product at a decent price point, it works really nicely on my back and body! \\n\\n@getjackblack glycolic cleanser has been a staple in my routine for years! I originally bought it for my hubby but ended up using it myself - it doubles as a mask. Definitely better suited for oily skin. \\n\\n@larocheposay toreliene cleanser is so gentle, and works well when my skin barrier is compromised! Can’t go wrong with this brand. \\n\\n@naturiumskin love the peptide moisturizer! Bought it on a whim when I was on vacation in Hawaii and haven’t looked back. I really like the packaging for travel! \\n\\n@sachiskin hyperpigmentation line up is awesome - any time I recommend it the person always comes back loving the range - the only downside is the cost, but I love shopping from small business owners so I am ok to pay for the quality!! \\n\\n@deciem glycolic acid is a staple…on my body and scalp! I don’t use it on my face anymore but continue to rebuy for above! \\n\\n@beautyofjoseon_official sunscreen is top tier. Doesn’t feel like SPF, provides long lasting protection in my case, and doesn’t burn or sting my eyes!\\n\\n@shiseido sun stick is my all time fave…never go wrong with this product! No white cast, eye burn, or greasy application! \\n\\n❎Why I would PASS:\\n\\nFAB KP eraser works…but the packaging is so frustrating and with other options on the market now it’s not something I’d rebuy (unless they fix the packaging / consistency) \\n\\nBiossance jelly cleanser - love the pink color, but didn’t find the price / quality ratio worth it for me! It’s a one time buy.\\n\\nFarmacy honey halo - wanted to love this so badly, and I adore the packaging, but found it sat on my skin and didn’t provide the support my dry skin needed. \\n\\nDE peptide - a good product, but given the price not one I continue to buy, given all the other alternatives.\\n\\nREN glycolic toner - my dislike for this product is known! It’s just so sticky and tacky on my skin no matter what I do 😭 \\n\\nSorry for the essay \\U0001fae3\\n        hashtags: \\n        mentions: @theinkeylist @getjackblack @larocheposay @naturiumskin @sachiskin @deciem @beautyofjoseon_official @shiseido\\n        commentsCount: 34\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 59265\\n        videoPlayCount: 237735\\n        ownerUsername: uglyducklingskincare\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Agree with suwasoo and farmacy\\nInteresting, I used the Pharmacy Honey Halo + Filling Good Hyaluronic Acid Serum during the winter season in Canada and loved how it kept my skin hydrated and glowing. 🍯\\nSuper agree with Biosssance!!!! Super expensive and yet when I finished their Retinol serum, no improvement at all..😵😭😭\\nThe background music that you've put is of a show called 'kaun banega crorepati' in India.

One of the best Japanese meals I have had post Covid. Definitely worth checking out for whoever loves Japanese food!!!\\n\\nAs I enter my early 40's I realise how important it is to spend time with those who offer you the most support. Your support system is so important in getting you through the hardest of times. My partner has been the most supportive throughout it all, especially when our country went through a near 2 years of lockdown.\\n\\nAlso I have learnt that life is worth so much more than that paycheck you work your butt off for at the end of the month. For me the most important thing right now is time, which is more precious than anything else as once lost you cannot get it back. Covid has taught me the importance of learning to slow down and re-prioritize what is really important in life. Life is too short to kill yourself for a company or to be a slave to that expensive loan for a status symbol item.\\n\\nWishing everyone out their find your joy and passion, sometimes your job is not your passion. This is true for 99% of the people who are stuck in a job right now. I cannot tell you how much more liberating it is to wake up each morning wanting to start your day because you are pursuing your passion. I wish everyone could reach that point of happiness too!!!\\n\\n#passion #pursuepassion #findjoy #passionnjoy #pursueyourpassion #sparkjoy #wisdom #wisewords #wisethoughts #contemplation\\n        hashtags: #passion #pursuepassion #findjoy #passionnjoy #pursueyourpassion #sparkjoy #wisdom #wisewords #wisethoughts #contemplation\\n        mentions: @fujiyama_japanese_restaurant\\n        commentsCount: 16\\n        likesCount: 13\\n        videoViewCount: 58\\n        videoPlayCount: 266\\n        ownerUsername: joannelek\\n        taggedUsers: @fujiyama_japanese_restaurant @fujiyama101\\n        latestComments: Late happy birthday bestie \\U0001f979💗\\U0001f979💗\\nOmg 😢 happy belated bday to you ❤️❤️❤️❤️ all the best wishes for youu😍😍😍😍\\nHappy belated birthday Joanne..may all your wishes come true🎉🎊🎂\\nYummy yummy 😋 ❤️ ❤️\\n@torichux3 Thank you very much Tori. 💜💜 Yea udah tua, birthday udah jadi benda yg enggak hairan bagi saya. 😂\\n        \", 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/joannelek/'}\n",

I keep going back and forth with whether I want to purchase it or not because I've read so many mixed reviews about it and a lot of people said it burned their eyes even when not applied near their eyes.\\nWhat’s your reasoning for this? Don’t like the package or it didn’t do the job.? I’ve tried about 60 different sunscreens & I usually don’t repurchase because they didn’t perform as well as they should, smelled weird to me, felt unpleasant on my skin, caused irritation or breakout or were difficult to source. I currently cycle through 4 different Australian sunscreens because the spf is higher & the ingredients are safer. Anything under spf 30 is a moisturiser.\\nI didn't like the supergoop Unseen. It made my skin feel so greasy. 😢\\n        \", 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/uglyducklingskincare/'}\n",

Most viral videos I’ve seen of glass skin definitely use filters. Real skin has pores and pigmentation and lines and whatnot. \\n\\nSecondly, I think it’s important to use this space to show non-perfect skin & how that is perfectly normal. As a skincare junkie my algorithm just shows me people with perfect skin and it can really get to me sometimes. So sharing this feels a bit scary for me. But I think it’s important to do it! \\n\\nI’m 32 and I deal with pigmentation (sun damage and melasma), clogged pores and some redness. My skin has definitely been worse but it’s also not the clearest it’s ever been. \\n\\nFor full transparency: I have had Botox in the past and besides an extensive skincare routine I also get facials (usually microneedling) every month or two. \\n\\nDoes social media ever make you feel insecure about your skin?\\n\\n#realskin #glassskin #30plusskincare\\n        hashtags: #realskin #glassskin #30plusskincare\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 28\\n        likesCount: 196\\n        videoViewCount: 3638\\n        videoPlayCount: 12281\\n        ownerUsername: deskincarejunkie\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Hier precies hetzelfde\\nIk heb ook hyperpigmentatie/ melasma, al vanaf mijn 25ste ongeveer..en ben nu 44.

You have beautiful skin by the way 😍 and to answer your question, social media doesn't make me feel insecure about my skin.\\n@elisaatje_roose voor mij hebben behandelingen met micro needling + tranexaminezuur heel erg geholpen!

I think the biggest thing is, I truly would have never in 10 million years guessed that I had Lyme but, welp, I do. If you are suspecting that you may have it, be sure to run a Lyme panel to see for sure.\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\nI know there is a big emotional factor to Lyme as well, which very much makes sense for me. I am very sensitive, and have held in a lot of resentment towards people who have done me wrong in the past and it’s time to get rid of it all because I know, it’s not helping.\\u2063😣\\n\\u2063\\nHolding in bad emotions only makes us sick so I know that plays a part here for me too, but with Lyme disease, stress makes me even more sick so some days are worse than others and I need a better plan. \\n\\nSo, anyhoo... I am excited and eager to start investing back into my health to heal. I’m also excited to share with you all here what works and does not work so if you have any Lyme tips, please send ‘em my way and hopefully others can benefit from them too! 🙌🏻\\n\\n#lymedisease #lymediseaseawareness #lymetreatment\\n        hashtags: #lymedisease #lymediseaseawareness #lymetreatment\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 564\\n        likesCount: 1287\\n        videoViewCount: 27838\\n        videoPlayCount: 73668\\n        ownerUsername: organicbunny\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Longevity Health Center in Roswell, GA cured a family members lime naturally!\\n@ultrawellnesscenter they are amazing!

Easy breezy, filtered water or liquid of your choice carried thru TSA, here is how! ⬇️\\n\\nTSA allows larger amounts of medically necessary liquids, gels, and aerosols in reasonable quantities for your trip, but you must declare them to security officers at the checkpoint for inspection so here is what we say! ❤️\\u200d🩹\\n\\nAs you approach the scanners and put your items in the bins, we just say “We have water for medication”. This can be whatever you take for “medical” reasons which for me are various supplements. And that’s it.

In the first clip, my hormones were obviously off- I was retaining water and puffy, I was exhausted, and my skin was a mess. \\n\\nHere’s what I’ve been doing to get my body and hormones realigned: \\n1. The retreat @palazzodivarignana helped kickstart everything! I tweaked my diet and really focused on quality sleep. \\n2. I took a break from high impact exercises and did Pilates/long walks for about two months. This allowed my body to rest and recover. \\n3. I did a supplement cleanse for two weeks, then slowly added them back in. I cut several supplements out and just kept the ones that I could see and feel a difference with. \\n4. I focused on my intermittent fasting and found a schedule that works for me. \\n5. @contour_club weekly. I will do cryo and the pod or a lemon bottle treatment. This not only helps with maintaining my weight but it’s also fantastic for recovery. \\n\\nIf you’ve been struggling with hormones lately, what has helped you?? \\n\\n#hormonehealth #cortisol #motivationforfitness #fitnessjourney\\n\\nRelated: Hormones, Hormone Health, Fitness Before and Afters, High Cortisol\\n        hashtags: #hormonehealth #cortisol #motivationforfitness #fitnessjourney\\n        mentions: @palazzodivarignana @contour_club\\n        commentsCount: 67\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 11888\\n        videoPlayCount: 31577\\n        ownerUsername: happilyhughes\\n        taggedUsers: @contour_club\\n        latestComments: GIIIIRL 🔥\\nWould u ever cut ur hair shorter?\\nYou look amazing!

I try to use my minis for travel. I also split my skincare allotment with my husband so can get away with bringing a little more since he brings none!\\n\\nI have had security throw out my stuff in the past so it’s important to follow the guidelines exactly! \\n\\nSheet masks don’t seem to count in the allotment so I keep those in another compartment in my bag!

I've never been on one 😂\\nI’m too scared to be this brazen (I’ve seen people get stopped even at airports in the US for not following the liquid bag rules, I think the last time I was at DFW) *but* I’ve found they absolutely shouldn’t be jerks if you label one bag with MEDICINE and put your mini stuff in there that is remotely medicinal (balms, tinctures, inhalers, SUNSCREEN) and then keep all of the obvious skincare in your regular quart size bag. It’s part of the TSA policy to allow all medical liquids (even beyond the quart size bag) as long as they are clearly labeled/called out.\\nHey! To everyone flying to Europe, you can only have the amount of bottles that fits into a 1 litre clear plastic baggy. TSA WILL get mad about it because we expect everyone to follow the rule, but people don’t. Save yourself the hassle and just get a bunch of samples instead if you’re coming for just a few days with a cabin bag.\\nThese are so cute😍\\nI learned the hard way this is not the case at London Heathrow airport. They will only give you one small clear bag. They will make you throw out anything else and will not allow you more than 1 clear small bag. I think it fit 4 small bottles in it. I was really upset i had to throw out so many things even when it was just a layover there and my luggage was fine at all other airport. they were so rude.\\nWhy didnt you use it?\\n@whatsupcourtney oh heck no. I'd never let anyone throw my stuff away!! I'd be telling her that someone will get it or something. No way.\\n        \", 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/uglyducklingskincare/'}\n",

However, once I understood how to read a label, I cringed seeing what I had been drinking all of those years!😖\\n\\n❌ High fructose corn syrup- This has links to insulin resistance, an increase of fat production, cancer, and type 2 diabetes, just to name a few.\\n\\n❌ Red 40- This petroleum-derived dye, specifically, has links to ADHD, immune disorders, migraines, behavioral changes, depression and more.\\n\\n❌ Blue 1- Another petroleum-derived, pointless dye that has shown to cross the blood-brain barrier with more links to hyperactivity and an increased risk of kidney tumors. \\n\\nSo, after seeing someone make one at home last week, I wondered... was it possible to make a cleaner Shirley Temple? It turns out, it IS! And, it was pretty damn easy if I do say so myself. \\n\\nWe tried out 3 different types of “healthier” soda as the base and the Reed’s Ginger Ale was today’s winner. However, I want to look for an even simpler Organic Ginger Soda this week. For now, Reed’s works well and I liked that it used Organic Ginger.🍃\\n\\nNext, you want to take Organic Pomegranate Juice and a clean sweetener of your choice. Today, we used Organic Cane Sugar, however, it was still pretty sweet to me. I want to play around with maple syrup next!\\n\\nTo make the Organic Grenadine syrup all you do is mix 1 cup pom juice with 1 cup of sugar. Again, this was WAY too sweet for me, combined with the Ginger sweetness, so I will fine tune the recipe and be back later. For now, sweeten to your liking.\\n\\nBring the juice + sugar to a simmer on medium heat and once the sugar is dissolved, then remove from heat and let it thicken. That’s it! Dye free, much cleaner syrup! 🙌🏻\\n\\nAnd that’s it! You pour your ginger ale, add a splash of your syrup and enjoy! We did pop in a few non-GMO maraschino cherries in for fun, however, they are not needed. You could make your own but, I am too lazy for that hehe. 🍒\\n\\nAnyway, there you have it!

It’s formulated with peptides and ceramides to promote skin surface turnover while minimising any discomfort like redness or dryness.\\n\\nIt’s often said that you shouldn’t start retinol from the age of 25, as that’s when your skins collagen production starts to drop. But this isn’t a universal truth! Thanks to sun exposure and pollution this can happen as early as 18, causing things like dullness, more visible pores and fine lines. But I don’t think you should immediately ‘attack’ your skin with a high % of retinol in your teens - slow and steady wins the race (and minimises irritation). Which is where a gentle, micro-dose retinol like this one works really well. 🥰\\n\\nBut remember: SPF is your BFF!

Once learned, these basics can be tweaked & adjusted to unlock a myriad of makeup possibilities, & for the very first time, I’m going to be sharing them. Together with @skillsfaster, I’ve put together a course which passes these techniques on to YOU; I’ll show you the way I prepare skin for makeup & the different ways I perfect the complexion. I’ll pass on my straightforward technique for finding a flattering eye makeup for ANY eye, how to create a sensuous, long-lasting lip, & how to finesse & balance your finished look. The level of subtlety or drama you decide to create with these techniques is entirely up to you. I’ll also tell you about my makeup philosophy & my journey to becoming the makeup artist I am today, as well as giving you a peek into my professional makeup kit.\\n\\nFollow the link in my bio to discover the course.\\n\\n❤️\\n\\n#makeupartist #mua #makeuptutorial #makeupcourse\\n        hashtags: #makeupartist #mua #makeuptutorial #makeupcourse\\n        mentions: @skillsfaster,\\n        commentsCount: 122\\n        likesCount: 2995\\n        videoViewCount: 70037\\n        videoPlayCount: 200778\\n        ownerUsername: babskymakeup\\n        taggedUsers: @babskymakeup @skillsfaster\\n        latestComments: How long is this available?\\nWow!

What’s your preferred method?\\n\\nAnother method a lot of people use is measuring with their fingers: using two (or three if you want to include your neck & ears) fingers length of sunscreen to get enough for your face. I use this when I don’t have my measuring spoon nearby, but it’s not my preferred way as it can really differ per sunscreen. Some are much more watery and thin so it’s hard to measure it this way!\\n\\n#sunscreentips #sunscreeneveryday #spfisyourbff #sunscreenalways\\n        hashtags: #sunscreentips #sunscreeneveryday #spfisyourbff #sunscreenalways\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 17\\n        likesCount: 249\\n        videoViewCount: 3970\\n        videoPlayCount: 9042\\n        ownerUsername: deskincarejunkie\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Een andere veel gemaakte fout is denk ik dat mensen exact de juiste hoeveelheid afwegen voor hun gezicht, maar dan bv met beide handen uitsmeren of eerst tussen beide handen opwarmen, uiteindelijk heb je dan natuurlijk een aanzienlijke hoeveelheid op je handen zitten, en dus niet meer de correcte hoeveelheid in het gezicht.\\nThanks didn't know that I needed to use that much. Very often I use sunscreen at the end of my skincare routine so little felt like enough.\\n🤍\\nIk gebruik iedere dag zonnebrand en gebruik de ‘2 vinger regel’.

Follow @uglyducklingskincare for beauty and skincare content! This is part 2 of skincare things I’m doing / not doing in pregnancy and why 👇 \\n\\n1) I am NOT avoiding chemical sunscreens, because the evidence isn’t compelling that they cause any issues, and my thoughts are any sunscreen is better than no sunscreen. My dermatologist and OBGYN both told me that my skin would be more sensitive during pregnancy, especially in the summer, so wearing spf is a must! If you prefer to stick with mineral ones, that’s totally your call! I have faves across both and alternate depending on the day or how I’m feeling. \\n\\n2) with pregnancy comes major sweating…seriously, buckets. 🪣 I’ve been using antiperspirant at night - my fave one is from @vichylaboratoires and it’s made a world of difference for me! \\n\\n3) I know, with pregnancy comes dry lips for some, but you should never apply aquaphor or Vaseline to your lips before going out in the sun (this is a general rule), since it could cause a nasty sunburn, especially if you aren’t wearing sunscreen! Instead, use a hydrating lip balm with sun protection included! Let me know if you want any reccos!\\n\\n4) I am sticking to my normal skincare routine and really emphasizing brightening products that are helping me target hyperpigmentation and old acne marks. I’m so glad I’ve kept this part the same given so many other changes! \\n\\nIt’s always best to consult your obgyn & dermatologist at this time, which I did with mine, along with doing some of your own due diligence as well. It all comes down to your own risk tolerance, and you should always do what feels right for you. \\n\\nHope this is helpful!

I just say- “I have sensitivities, can you use my product instead? Be sure to read them the directions and let them know you don’t expect any warranty.\\n\\nThe best way to apply this is to apply thin layers to 2 nails at a time. If you apply thick layers, it will slip around before curing.\\n\\nYou DO need either a UV lamp or the sun. It’s quite simple!

Instead, bring it up a wee bit and add some very dark brown shadow to create a slight v-shape from under the corner to the upper lid. Use the brown to soften the harshness of the black liner for a daytime look and add more black for a night-time look.\\nI’m a former professional makeup artist and have always been a fan of the cat-eye look.

Upper lip botox is used for fine creasing above the lip line - as an ex=smoker, I have some that on the whole, I just ignore. But, with a background in journalism, upper lip botox is something I tried about ten years ago so I could write about it. What a disaster - I could not sip and I could not spit (for tooth brushing that was a major problem) so I wanted to see how the treatment has progressed. I had the tiniest little amount and still, it’s left me with some restricted mouth movements - most obviously the ‘mwah’ which is a pain for applying lipstick but luckily I’m able to spit out my toothpaste and sip my tea this time. I’m laughing about it because it’s just so silly but you need to think twice about having this - yes, it absolutely works on the skin creasing but it’s not side-effect free :-))) #botox #finelines\\n        hashtags: #botox #finelines\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 38\\n        likesCount: 175\\n        videoViewCount: 2516\\n        videoPlayCount: 6246\\n        ownerUsername: britbeautyblog\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: When I used to write for the paper I did all sorts of treatments.

At the start, I honestly didn’t know how to recycle my empties, so I kept them (and they’ve really piled up over the years). But as time has passed, and more people recognize the massive waste caused by the beauty industry and demand more options for sustainability, there have been some great ways to responsibly recycle your products. Please don’t throw them in the trash! 🗑️ \\n\\nI’ll show you ways you can get rid of your products! ♻️ \\n\\nAs a side note, no one needs this many products, and I only have this many because I test them for this page, or ask family / friends to test and give me back their empties. Even then, this is WAY more than anyone needs. Products I get in PR and don’t use, I give away. The ones I use, I do my best to empty.

So, I applied the gel slightly past her natural nail onto the skin and cured. \\n\\nThen, I use my pusher to seperate the gel from the finger. \\n\\nTom’s Tip: Apply a thin amount of cuticle oil to the skin before the gel to make it easier to seperate. 🧴\\n\\nNext, size and prep your tips.💅 \\n\\nThen, I use #MiaSecret Nail Gel Glue and apply a small amount in the cuticle area on the underside of the tip.\\n\\nApply your tip by placing the cuticle area down first. Lightly press the gel out to the end of the natural nail and cure.\\n\\nDetermine your length and refine your shape. 💪\\nI always like a slight taper to the nail regardless of the shape.\\n\\nTo help camouflage the natural nail, I apply a coat of #MiaSecret Gelux Gel Nail Polish in Marshmallow. Then, I used #MiaSecret Gelux Gel Nail Polish in white and a stripper brush to create the smilelines. 🤍\\n\\nI keep the smileline more narrow and further toward the tip of the nail to create the illusion of a longer nail bed.\\n\\nTo soften the white and add depth to your French, use a sheer nude like #MiaSecret Gel Nail Polish in Rose Petal on top. \\n\\nFinish it all off with #MiaSecret Luxury Base and Top Gel for that celebrity red carpet high gloss shine. 🤩\\n        hashtags: #nailsbytombachik #MiaSecret\\n        mentions: @miasecret @miasecret’s\\n        commentsCount: 9\\n        likesCount: -1\\n        videoViewCount: 17331\\n        videoPlayCount: 51327\\n        ownerUsername: tombachik\\n        taggedUsers: @miasecret\\n        latestComments: 💅🏿😍😍😍\\n😍\\nClassy\\n🔥🔥🔥\\n😍\\nYou make it look so easy! 😍\\n😍😍😍😍😍\\nSLAY\\n😍\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/tombachik/'}\n",

In a nutshell, child labour, denied by local factories, is a real thing despite local laws. The onus lies on the fragrance and beauty brands to check, check and check again that children aren’t being exploited in the name of beauty. Whether it’s getting up at 3am because their mother has nowhere to leave them and accompanying her to the fields or being exposed to pesticides, or joining the picking, it’s not good at all. Idole Intense (Lancome) and Aerin Ikat Jasmine are the named brands using Egyptian jasmine and responsible for those pickers being paid $1 a day. It would take almost a year for them to be able to buy the product they’re being paid to produce. None of this is new news because we all know it happens - good example is carnauba wax extraction in Brazil. It’s exploitative and dangerous and brands we know and love have not made it enough of their business to pay properly and add in safety measurers. #perfumesdarksecrets \\n\\n—\\n        hashtags: #perfumesdarksecrets\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 29\\n        likesCount: 149\\n        videoViewCount: 1795\\n        videoPlayCount: 4748\\n        ownerUsername: britbeautyblog\\n        taggedUsers: @natashajcox\\n        latestComments: 😢\\nShall read this.

You are the only beauty journalist or influencer (I know you hate that term) that has spoken about this, from the ones I follow on bialy.

Could also be your foundation formula doesn’t mix well with the skincare or spf. Try a damp Beautyblender to apply foundation.\\n@tobimakeup  thanks beauty queen 👸 🥂🙏\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/tobimakeup/'}\n",

Here’s the quote: ‘These days you are never too old to start a question with: “Am I too old?” But you still have to ask, depending upon what you are thinking about wearing, “are my legs/upper arms/boobs too old?” If you have great pins, go for it. If you don’t, denim culottes can be a good way to channel the mood without the knee reveal’. Literally, what kind of age-shaming, body shaming nonsense is this from one our leading publications. The way it so easily tripped out of the brain onto the keyboard is shocking. It might be news to @thetimes but these days, older women are proud to be their age, they don’t need guidance from someone who sets out by singling out limbs as ‘not for public view’ after a certain age. Have they been to an Italian beach or a French beach where everyone, young and old, is in their swimmies just loving the sea and loving life?  Age and style are not related, in the same way that age and beauty are not related so honestly, shut up and do better. \\n\\n—\\n        hashtags: \\n        mentions: @thetimes\\n        commentsCount: 151\\n        likesCount: 566\\n        videoViewCount: 4617\\n        videoPlayCount: 10966\\n        ownerUsername: britbeautyblog\\n        taggedUsers: @thetimes\\n        latestComments: Maybe a movement should start where we all go out with our aging tits, knees and arms and have a stand-off against the lemons in culottes 😂\\nAmen to this. \\nWell said 🙌🙌\\n#weartheshorts\\n❤️❤️❤️\\nPerfect rant, I’m right there with you!\\nHow is it still possible to  be even allowed in our society to write such prestigious nonsense?

My makeup looks flat. My brows are too dark. I also don’t like the under eye circles or shallowness. Wow my hair looks frizzy… I could be so much prettier if I got faux lashes, filler under my eyes, lip filler and botox to make my skin more firm and the truth is- I could do that. It would be a seemingly easy fix but, it wouldn’t fix the actual root cause issue of me not loving myself.😏\\n\\nThis is what we’re conditioned to do and to think and I hate it. I hate that I have these thoughts and I hate that other women may too! As we are sold pokes and plumps with the promises that then, then… we’ll be enough.\\n\\nBotox alone generates 718 million, annually. We are quite literally sold these toxic thoughts for their toxic profit/products and that’s sickening to me.\\n\\nBut, to me, what’s more important is learning to NOT have these thoughts OR to have them and let them pass. To remind myself that it’s just not that serious and even if I did all of that, I’d still find flaws to pick at so, why bother? What can I do to shift my thoughts onto something more important and meaningful? At the very least, refusing to allow someone else to profit off of my own self hate keeps me away.\\n\\nAnd btw, this isn’t a compliment trap, you don’t have to tell me anything, good or bad, I was mostly wanting to share the thoughts so many of us have, how I handle them and how you may handle them too? Always looking for tips on how to age gracefully (40) in a World that demonizes it.\\U0001f979\\n\\nAnyway, if you got this far, try these new electrolytes 😂 They’re so good lol and that was the intended point of this video.

If you are minded to, you can probably create this with products you already have - blend the lip crayon into the centre of the lip ombre style and then coat with gloss, then you can move to LA and present the news.\\n        hashtags: \\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 6\\n        likesCount: 114\\n        videoViewCount: 2102\\n        videoPlayCount: 5142\\n        ownerUsername: britbeautyblog\\n        taggedUsers: @hudabeauty\\n        latestComments: Out of all the things you’ve tried, this is more ‘who has eaten the chocolate’ vibe than glam newsreader.

But after 3 layers, the tone up is a bit more noticeable and by the 4th layer it truly was a little too much for me too.

We realized my mistake an hour later and by then Boris and Igor were gone. \\n\\n12 hours later they were spotted by a logger, but by the time my husband and neighbor @wanderingwoodsfarms got there it was too late. The next day my friend @tammybeeler3 got a call from her friend Chuck. She had tagged Chuck in a Facebook post I made about them being lost, because he lives at Camp Wilkerson, a 280 acre park near my house and Tammy knew he was a guy who should know about the dogs being lost. \\n\\nWhen she answered the phone she couldn’t hear what Chuck was saying but could hear cow bells in the background. She knew our dogs had bells on their collars and put two and two together. She called me, then I called my husband Adam and he drove 20+ miles on winding logging roads to pick them up. \\n\\nWhen he got there our mystery man hero Chuck wasn’t there but a hiker was there holding Boris and Igor’s collars, ensuring they stayed safe. From what we know somebody spotted Igor, but couldn’t catch him, he ran off back into the forest and then re-emerged with his brother Boris. \\n\\nThank you to everyone who helped. From the bottom of my heart. \\n\\n44 hours after these dogs left our land we had them back. They walked at least 30, maybe 40, 50 miles (?) and are uninjured but sore from all that walking and skinnier than when they left. It was the most painful 44 hours of my life but I am happier than I’ve ever been to have them safe and home. \\n\\nI’ve learned a lot of lessons in the last couple days and won’t go too into it but the gist is:\\n\\n1. Multitasking doesn’t work for me and I’ll never be fully present for each task when trying to do multiple things at the same time. And I want to be present in life. Multitasking is one way I stay busy/distracted and it results in me being less present. I am now actively working to remedy this and change my ways\\n2. Community is everything. The kindness we were shown was beautiful, I’ll forever be grateful to our neighbors and friends for their big hearts and kind words\\n3. There’s something bigger out there than just me and my worries and my little life 🙏🏼\\n        hashtags: \\n        mentions: @wanderingwoodsfarms @tammybeeler3\\n        commentsCount: 24\\n        likesCount: 151\\n        videoViewCount: 1591\\n        videoPlayCount: 3836\\n        ownerUsername: alamanoskincare\\n        taggedUsers: @wanderingwoodsfarms @risingtidehomestead\\n        latestComments: Ah!

It is the one in the silver colored bottle but I think I’ve just about tried all of the brands sprays by now.  It absolutely is high performance- I first saw it years ago at TJ maxx on clearance!  I finally used it one day in the peak DC summer with humidity at uncomfortably high levels because, isn’t that when everyone wants under eye concealer?  Exactly.  Lol.  I started sweating almost immediately outside which is common for me in July-August.  I arrived at my destination 30 min later and the concealer was totally intact.  After like only 2 pumps sprayed each side of my face.  Later, after much use, I discovered that you can actually make overly mattified skin miraculously appear quite dewy if you apply one or two extra coats, and allow the coats dry in between.  From desert matte to bouncing light.\\n👏👏❤️\\nPrettyyyyy 💫💫💫💙 a classic fav for me is one called model in a bottle, haven't used it in a sec tho 🥰\\nHi! What foundation is she wearing?

This is a lot more than you think it is! I now always use a measuring spoon the first times I use a new sunscreen, to get a feel for how much I should apply. \\n\\nDROPPER: if your serum comes in a dropper, don’t let the dropper touch your face! The dropper’s purpose is to help you dose the right amount of product, not for spreading it onto your skin. Your products formula will not have enough preservatives in it to account for the bacteria in your skin ending up in the bottle, so this can mess with the stability, efficacy and shelf life of your skincare!\\n\\nALL NEW PRODUCTS: I was very enthusiastic in the beginning and started a full 10-step skincare routine with products that were completely new to me. Result: I had a bad reaction to a product, but I had no idea which one of the 10 caused it! Solution: start with a basic routine (cleanser, moisturiser & SPF) and gradually add in new products. \\n\\nOVER EXFOLIATING: after reading what a glycolic acid exfoliant could do for me, I figured “best use it as often as possible to reap as many of these benefits”. All this did for me was damage my skin barrier and make my skin bright red 🥲\\n\\nHIGH % ACTIVES: similar to the glycolic acid story, I got wrapped up in all the possible benefits from the active ingredients I was looking up (like vitamin C and retinol). I thought a high strength, high frequency multi-active approach would be the quickest way to give me the skin of my dreams, but my skin disagreed. I overloaded my skin and actually ended up with flaky, irritated skin that took a long time to heal!\\n\\n➡️ what was your biggest mistake with skincare when you first started out with it?\\n\\n#skincaremistakes #skincarefail #skincarefreaks #skincaretips #skincaretip #skincare101\\n        hashtags: #skincaremistakes #skincarefail #skincarefreaks #skincaretips #skincaretip #skincare101\\n        mentions: \\n        commentsCount: 70\\n        likesCount: 2413\\n        videoViewCount: 99654\\n        videoPlayCount: 140368\\n        ownerUsername: deskincarejunkie\\n        taggedUsers: \\n        latestComments: Beautiful \\U0001faf6🏾\\n👏👏👏\\nSuch a good share!\\nVery relatable! 👏🏼\\nRelatable 🙌\\nNot brushing your teeth before your skincare 😢\\n        ', 'profileURL': 'https://www.instagram.com/deskincarejunkie/'}\n",

Yea please! Love gel nail polish but not the ingredients? Come try a cleaner gel manicure option with me that, get this… cures in the SUN! ☀️\\n\\nComment GEL to try it! 😍\\n\\nThese polishes are amazing because they are made free of the top five common harsh chemicals often found in other gel polishes: formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, BHA and camphor. ❌\\n\\nThese gel polishes are also water-based and enriched with vitamins and minerals to promote overall nail strengthening so they never damage my nails! 💫\\n\\nWith proper prep and application, I can now enjoy over 2+ weeks of high shine and chip-free gel nails with fewer toxins. 🤗\\n\\nHow To: Each color can be used as a base, color, and top coat in one, however, for best results I use the base + top coat. 💅🏻\\n\\nI bring mine to ANY salon. I just say- “I have sensitivities, can you use my product instead? Be sure to read them the directions and let them know you don’t expect any warranty.\\n\\nThe best way to apply this is to apply thin layers to 2 nails at a time.
